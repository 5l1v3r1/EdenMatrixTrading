# How It Works

THIS PART IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS
TRYING TO WRITE AN EASY WAY TO UNDERSTAND THE STRATEGY
SO PEOPLE USING THE SOFTWARE HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW IT WORKS :)

Here's a quick explanation of how this works.
In the past, when I would invest,
Say I have $1,000 to invest,
I'm feeling pretty good about amazon, google and apple,
I spend my $1,000 on those 3 stocks,
then wait...
and worry...
Maybe the price goes up,
which is great but,
the whole time I'm stressed,
because even if it's up today,
it could just as easily go down tomorrow,

And say it went down today,
I'm twice as stressed,
because it could go down again tomorrow!
and never come back up!! AHHHHHH!!!!

Now we don't ever know which way the market is going to go,
so this kind of trading is basically gambling.

And I don't like gambling,
it's too freaking stressful,
so I eventually sell off my stocks,
usually at a small loss or gain,
and say I obviously don't know enough about investing,
and I put my money back into a .000001% interest savings account,
in an currency inflating every year by 3 to 7 percent,
and wonder why I'm always broke...

Here's where the infomercial would say,
"But there's got to be a better way!"
(look toward camera, Ding!)

And there is :)

There's one thing we can count on in the markets,
prices will change.
By how much we can't be sure,
but by 1.9% seems to me to be a pretty safe bet.

But for simplicity sake,
and to make the math easy,
lets say the stock we want to buy sells today for $5,
and lets say for arguments sake,
We can bet on 20 percent price swings,
the math of which would look like this:
.2 * $5 = $1
Giving us $1 increments

So what this is saying is,
we think the price will swing $1 one way or the other
pretty frequently over time,
again these numbers will change in practical terms when we actually
want to use this strategy because most markets don't swing a dollar every day,
but again this is for simplicity to explain the idea.

Now after we choose our $1 increments,
we have to set a range we we think the market will live in for the foreseeable future,
So lets set the top of our range,
twice the current $5 market price,
So 2 * $5 = $10
So we don't think the price is going to go above $10 too soon
Now lets set the bottom of our range,
80 percent down from the $5 market price should cover it,
so our bottom range would be $1.

This means we think the market will live betwen $1 and $10 for awhile,
And swing every day by $1 a couple times,

So now lets go back to our $1,000 we want to invest,
instead of buying 200 shares @ $5 today,

lets spread our $1,000 over the whole price range,
so for example,
Lets allocate 1/10 of our investment,
to each $1 price peg,

(Oh yeah and I should mention,
I'll call our $1 increments:
$1, $2, $3, etc, up to $10
pegs from now on.
So if say lets buy 18 of the $5 peg,
that just means lets buy 18 shares @ $5)

so

$100 would buy 10 shares @ $10
$100 would buy 11.1 shares @ $9
$100 would buy 12.5 shares @ $8
$100 would buy 14.3 shares @ $7
$100 would buy 16.6 shares @ $6
$100 would buy 20 shares @ $5
$100 would buy 25 shares @ $4
$100 would buy 33.3 shares @ $3
$100 would buy 50 shares @ $2
$100 would buy 100 shares @ $1



Now the big idea here is that,
every time you buy at one of these pegs,
you then set up a sell,
one peg up,
meaning,
I buy 20 shares @ $5 today,
then I set up a sell for 20 shares @ $6
then market price hits $6,
I now have $120 from my original $100,
I can now reset my $100 buy,
and I have an extra $20 to either cash out,
or reinvest,
I can buy 4 more shares @ $5,
Or I can start filling in the bottom of my matrix below .5,
Or I can add to what I call a moon bucket,
which is the 1st peg above your matrix,
so as you add value from a market swinging back and forth from $5 to $6 dollars,



and dived that by our lower peg of $5, so 120/5
gives u our new $5 peg volume,

and set a buy for $120 @ $5 or 24 shares



Now, lets start to spend some money :)

To decide what to buy today,
we buy up all our pegs at and above current market of $5,
so:
$5, $6, $7, $8, $9 and $10
and with the rest of our investment
we set buys for:
$1, $2, $3, and $4

So we have 6 pegs above market,
so we spend $600 buying them











or

as my wife just reminded me,
we can buy the same volume at each $1 price,
this is a little trickier to explain,
but hey lets try,

so to find your volume,
you sum your price points,
the price points being
$1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7, $8, $9, $10
If we add all those numbers up we get:
$55

This means the cost to buy one share at each of those pegs adds up to $55
And since we have $1,000 to invest,
Lets find out how many shares we can buy at each price evenly,
$1,000/$55
and we get...
18.1818181818181818on_to_infinity, lets round down to:
18
So we now know we can buy 18 shares at each $1 peg,
that would look like this

We can buy:
18 shares @ $10
18 shares @ $9
18 shares @ $8
18 shares @ $7
18 shares @ $6
18 shares @ $5
18 shares @ $4
18 shares @ $3
18 shares @ $2
18 shares @ $1

So these are two different approaches to the Eden Matrix strategy,
We call the top one: static value,
meaning we buy the same USD value at each price peg,
and the bottom one: static volume,
meaning we buy the same volume, or amount of stocks at each price peg,
for math purposes I'm going to use static value in this example




Lets switch to alt coins instead of the stock market,
this strategy works in any market but I an idealist,
and I believe the power of alt coins is to
not just revolutionize money,
but evolve it, and in the process,
eliminate predatory central banks,
if you haven't found the research yet that proves central banks are predatory,
answer this question,
How is the USA,
which is sold to us as the most powerful,
wealthiest,
beacon of hope, light and freedom,
and all things apple pie and goodness,
and bootstrapped bizness men,
self made entrepreuners,
and the highest concentration of corporatations in the fortune 500,
and military bases in 138 countries around the world,
how is this country 20 trillion dollars in debt,
who is this country 20 trillion dollars in debt too?
when debt is a subserviant position,
Who is this almighty nation in debt to,
the federal reserve,
and why?
Well because the only way a dollar is created in america currently,
is when congress asks the federal reserve,
"oh federal reserve,
pretty please with cherries on top,
can you print some money from nothing,
to lend to us @ interest"
And lucky congress,
the Federal Reserve says sure thing!!!!!
And they print up that 100 billion dollars,
and say hey,
just pay us back 150 billion dollars,
and congress says sure thing! will do!
can't wait! we're a nation of boot strapped engineers,
with creatives bubbling up fuedled with ambition,
no way this country won't make that $150 billion out of the $100 billion,
and we'll all be right as rain.
Except, that $50 billion in interest,
Congress promised to pay as a thank you,
uhmm, one small tiny little detail,
almost insignificant really,
and not worth anyone in congress's attention really,
well that little detail is,
well truth be told,
the $50 billion in interest never was printed.
That's right,
the $100 billion in principle gets printed.
