Eden Project is a GPL 3.0 project meaning we are free to use this software so long as the work we do here is shared by all for the betterment of all. Real wealth is security for all. Individual wealth is an illusion of security. If you are rich, but your neighbor is poor
what does that dynamic do to each other's hearts? We hide away our true nature, true selves
as the poor man must dress, speak, act, look and do what the rich men expect
The human spirit didn't come here to scrape by. This life is to explore.
But we've been tricked into our own traps.

Fear is an illusion, on the other side of Fear is our Freedom.
The end of the old world based on fear and illusion of scarcity.

## Note 
 
There are two different implementations of EDEN Trading style. 
The Bryn_method and the Original method currently operate on different branches

to Wex market too, we will rename accordingly. currently they vary with
